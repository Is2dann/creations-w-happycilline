            <p>Hello, my name is Marta.</p>
            <p>
                You are probably wondering about the name "Creations with Happycilline."
                Well the short story is, that I love cats and I have a beautiful Calico female cat called Happy,
                because she brought happiness into my life. And as pennicillin is strong health drug in medicine,
                as Happy is my health and mood drug for my everydays.
            </p>
            <p>
                I create handmade decorations for your home and for you. My signature pieces are the "Krapeks".
                This is a Hungarian word for "guys or fellas" in rough translation. <br>
                These funny and nice pieces can be customised for any kind of occasions or taste.
                Custom pieces usually not be shown in my products pages, unless they are allowed by the customer.
                Simply because these pieces can be any kind, some customer goes funny some are more than that...
