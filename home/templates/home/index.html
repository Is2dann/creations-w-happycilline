                    <!-- You are probably wondering about the name "Creations with Happycilline."
                    Well the short story is, that I love cats and I have a beautiful Calico female cat called Happy,
                    because she brought happiness into my life. And as pennicillin is strong health drug in medicine,
                    as Happy is my health and mood drug for my everydays. -->
                    The name <em>Creations with Happycilline</em> is a mash-up of my calico cat, <strong>Happy</strong>
                    (chief supplier of purr-powered joy), and <em>penicillin</em> - because a little mix of craft and cat magic
                    is my daily dose of good vibes.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    <!-- I create handmade decorations for your home and for you. My signature pieces are the "Krapeks".
                    This is a Hungarian word for "guys or fellas" in rough translation. <br>
                    These funny and nice pieces can be customised for any kind of occasions or taste.
                    Custom pieces usually not be shown in my products pages, unless they are allowed by the customer.
                    Simply because these pieces can be any kind, some customer goes funny some are more than that... -->
                    I hand-make dÃ©cor and my signature <strong>The Krapeks</strong> (Hungarian for "little guys/fellas").
                    Each Krapek is custom - uniforms, hobbies, inside jokes - whatever makes you smile.
                    Custom pieces only appear in the shop with permission (some requests are... delightfully unpublishable ðŸ˜…).
